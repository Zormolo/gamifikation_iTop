# Gamifikation for iTop [Prototype]

This extension adds gamification functionality to iTop. It provides an additional player class which stores experience level, experience points and provides a level-up mechanism for a gamified working experience. People new to iTop will have a flat learning curve,  because features are enabled step-by-step depending on the experience level. Long time motivation will stay higher due to earned achievements.

## Level system 

Users gain EXP for different activities in iTop, e.g. creating an object, delet object or resolve a ticket. With every activity a user gains a weighted amount of EXP. The maximum level is planned to be 25. [more or infinite are possible as well] 

A user gets better user rights or more functionality from iTop for a higher level.

## EXP 

### Experiens point trigger 

| Trigger | EXP |
| -------- | -------- |
| assign ticket | 5 |
| ticket in status closed | 25 |
| update a object | 3 |
| delete a object | 1 |
| create a object | 10 |
| export from data | 15 |
| import from data | 20 |

## Character Classes 

Character classes are modified standard user profiles from iTop. Every class gets multiple versions of a profile. These profile versions are activated depending on the experience level of the user, to enable new features, functions or user-rights. 

## Archivements

It's planned to receive different types of achievements for working with iTop, e.g. first object created or 100 tickets solved.
